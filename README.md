# Data Science Project 1: SpaceX

This is my first data science project. It is considered the final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course, where I adquired more knowledge and experience on the field.

The data used is from the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage. 

You can find different Jupyter notebooks. By following their order, several steps of the data science methodology are performed until a machine learning model is developed to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
